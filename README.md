# [sqlshim] - PHP sqlsrv for Linux/OS X

The **sqlshim** project aims to replicate [Microsoft SQL Server Driver for PHP][sqlsrv] (**sqlsrv**) on Linux/OS X.

**sqlshim** was conceived out of the need for **[sqlsrv]** (a Windows-only PHP extension) in an OS X development environment. It began as a short script that defined a small set of functions. Unfortunately,

**DISCLAIMER:** **sqlshim** is in alpha and is geared primarily toward use in a development environment. It is provided as-is and without warranty. I will not be held responsible for any damage(s) incurred from its use.


## Basic Usage
1. ```\RadSectors\SqlShim::init();```
2. ```sqlsrv_connect( ... );```
3. ???
4. Profit!!
