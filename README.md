# **sqlshim** &bull; PHP sqlsrv for Linux/OS X

The **sqlshim** project aims to replicate [Microsoft SQL Server Driver for PHP][sqlsrv] (**sqlsrv**) on Linux/OS X.

**sqlshim** was born out of the need for **[sqlsrv]** functions in OS X. It started as a short script with a small set of functions and has since evolved into a nearly full replacement for **[sqlsrv]**.

**DISCLAIMER:** **sqlshim** is in alpha and is geared primarily toward use in a development environment. It is provided as-is and without warranty. I will not be held responsible for any damage(s) incurred from its use.<br>
Also, please note that despite its Mac origins, access to a proper Mac test environment has been limited (nonexistent) so I can't presently make any promises to Mac users.


## Basic Usage
1. `sqlsrv_connect( ... );`
2. ???
3. Profit!!
