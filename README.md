# **sqlshim** &bull; sqlsrv for Linux/OS X

**sqlshim** replicates [sqlsrv (Microsoft SQL Server Driver for PHP)](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql) functionality on Linux/OS X.

It began as a small set of spoofed sqlsrv functions and has since evolved into a full-on sqlsrv replacement.

It is currently in `alpha` and is primarily intended for use in dev environments or non-mission-critical applications. But I can't tell you what to do.


## Getting Started
1. `$ composer require "radsectors/sqlshim:dev-master"`
2. `<?php require 'vendor/autoload.php';`
3. ???
4. _Profit!_
